140. Word Break II

Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, 
add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. 
Return all such possible sentences.

Note:

The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
Example 1:

Input:
s = "catsanddog"
wordDict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"]
Output:
[
  "cats and dog",
  "cat sand dog"
]
Example 2:

Input:
s = "pineapplepenapple"
wordDict = ["apple", "pen", "applepen", "pine", "pineapple"]
Output:
[
  "pine apple pen apple",
  "pineapple pen apple",
  "pine applepen apple"
]
Explanation: Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
Example 3:

Input:
s = "catsandog"
wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output:
[]

        Letâ€˜s say the average word length in wordDict is k, so it takes n/k times to reach end.
        Each time, the helper function would be called and it's running time is O(m*n)
