86. Partition List

Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less 
than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

Example:

Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5

class ListNode:
    # Definition for singly-linked list.
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next


class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: ListNode, x: int) -> ListNode:
        h1 = l1 = ListNode(0)
        h2 = l2 = ListNode(0)
        while head:
            if head.val < x:
                l1.next = head
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                l2.next = head
                l2 = l2.next
            head = head.next
        l2.next = None
        l1.next = h2.next
        return h1.next
