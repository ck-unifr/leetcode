As we have described above, each number will definitely have a cycle.

    "- If the number N is less than or equal to 1000, \n",

    "From the above Wikipedia link, we know that the sum of the squares of the digits of ‘N’ is at most 9^2M, or 81M81M (this will happen when all digits of ‘N’ are ‘9’).\n",

    "Rotating by one node is very simple; just find the last node of the linked list and move it to the head of the linked list. One way of solving our original problem is to rotate by one node (i.e. last node of a linked list) n times. Getting to the last node of a linked list requires a linear scan, so this algorithm requires n scans of the linked list. The time complexity of this algorithm will be O(mn)O(mn) where mm is the length of the linked list and nn is the number of rotations needed. However, there is an alternate and simpler algorithm that avoids multiple scans of the linked list. We know that performing n rotations (if n > 0) of the last node is equivalent to performing one rotation of the last n nodes of the linked list. So O(n) algorithm to find the list rotated by n nodes is below:\n",

    "- Find the length of the linked list.\n",

    "- If the adjusted number of rotations is 0, then just return the head pointer. This means that no rotations were needed.\n",
    "\n",

    "Explanation: The 3rd smallest number among all the arrays is 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution #\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem follows the K-way merge pattern and we can follow a similar approach as discussed in Merge K Sorted Lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start merging all the arrays, but instead of inserting numbers into a merged list, we will keep count to see how many elements have been inserted in the merged list. Once that count is equal to ‘K’, we have found our required number.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big difference from Merge K Sorted Lists is that in this problem, the input is a list of arrays compared to LinkedLists. This means that when we want to push the next number in the heap we need to know what the index of the current number in the current array was. To handle this, we will need to keep track of the array and the element indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity #\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we’ll be going through at most ‘K’ elements among all the arrays, and we will remove/add one element in the heap in each step, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(K*logM) where ‘M’ is the total number of input arrays.\n",

    "\n",
    "Problem 1: Given ‘M’ sorted arrays, find the median number among all arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: This problem is similar to our parent problem with K=Median. So if there are ‘N’ total numbers in all the arrays we need to find the K’th minimum number where K=N/2K=N/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 2: Given a list of ‘K’ sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
