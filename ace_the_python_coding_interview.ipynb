As we have described above, each number will definitely have a cycle.

    "- If the number N is less than or equal to 1000, \n",

    "From the above Wikipedia link, we know that the sum of the squares of the digits of ‘N’ is at most 9^2M, or 81M81M (this will happen when all digits of ‘N’ are ‘9’).\n",

    "Rotating by one node is very simple; just find the last node of the linked list and move it to the head of the linked list. One way of solving our original problem is to rotate by one node (i.e. last node of a linked list) n times. Getting to the last node of a linked list requires a linear scan, so this algorithm requires n scans of the linked list. The time complexity of this algorithm will be O(mn)O(mn) where mm is the length of the linked list and nn is the number of rotations needed. However, there is an alternate and simpler algorithm that avoids multiple scans of the linked list. We know that performing n rotations (if n > 0) of the last node is equivalent to performing one rotation of the last n nodes of the linked list. So O(n) algorithm to find the list rotated by n nodes is below:\n",

    "- Find the length of the linked list.\n",

    "- If the adjusted number of rotations is 0, then just return the head pointer. This means that no rotations were needed.\n",
    "\n",

    "Explanation: The 3rd smallest number among all the arrays is 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution #\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem follows the K-way merge pattern and we can follow a similar approach as discussed in Merge K Sorted Lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start merging all the arrays, but instead of inserting numbers into a merged list, we will keep count to see how many elements have been inserted in the merged list. Once that count is equal to ‘K’, we have found our required number.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big difference from Merge K Sorted Lists is that in this problem, the input is a list of arrays compared to LinkedLists. This means that when we want to push the next number in the heap we need to know what the index of the current number in the current array was. To handle this, we will need to keep track of the array and the element indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity #\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we’ll be going through at most ‘K’ elements among all the arrays, and we will remove/add one element in the heap in each step, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(K*logM) where ‘M’ is the total number of input arrays.\n",

    "\n",
    "Problem 1: Given ‘M’ sorted arrays, find the median number among all arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: This problem is similar to our parent problem with K=Median. So if there are ‘N’ total numbers in all the arrays we need to find the K’th minimum number where K=N/2K=N/2.\n",

    "Problem 2: Given a list of ‘K’ sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted list.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Figure out whether the given words can form a circular chain. \n",
    "Assume that a single word can never form a chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two words can be chained together if the first word’s last letter is equal to the second word’s first letter. We are given a list of words and we need to figure out if all the words can be chained together or not. \n",
    "Let’s assume that all the words are lower case.        \n",
    "\n",
    "Solution #\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime complexity #\n",
    "\n",
    "The runtime complexity of the generate_graph method is quadratic, O(n^2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The runtime complexity of the check_cycle_rec method is factorial, O(n!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the recurrence relation for time complexity is:\n",
    "\n",
    "T(n) = O(n) + nT(n-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory complexity #\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory complexity of this solution is linear, O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "A recursive solution will consume memory on the stack as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive solution for this problem is to find all the permutations of these strings recursively, and then return true once a chain is detected. The run time for this approach will be O(n!), although, practically it will be lesser as we will prune permutations early if they are not conforming with our chaining logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better solution is to do a linear pass of the word list and construct a graph that represents the start and end characters of each word. We need to add an edge from the starting character of a word to its ending character for each word in the list. If there exists a cycle in this graph containing all the nodes, then a chain can be formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To form a chain connecting all the strings, the graph must be connected in such a way that if we start traversing it from any vertex, it should end at the same vertex. This ensures that all vertices have been visited and all edges have been traversed exactly once, thus forming a cycle which represents the chain of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to the concept of an Euler circuit of a graph. An Euler circuit is a circuit that uses every edge of a graph exactly once. It starts and ends at the same vertex. Therefore, we can find that a chain exists for a list of words if there exists an Euler circuit for the graph created by them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the Euler circuit of the graph, we need to ensure these two points:\n",
    "\n",

Since, at most, each pair of words can give us one rule, therefore, we can conclude that the upper bound for the rules is O(N) where ‘N’ is the number of words in the input.

    "Our goal is to choose projects that give us the maximum profit. \n",
    "Write a function that returns the maximum total capital after selecting the most profitable projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start an investment project only when we have the required capital. \n",
    "Once a project is selected, we can assume that its profit has become our capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: Project Capitals=[0,1,2], Project Profits=[1,2,3], Initial Capital=1, Number of Projects=2\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With initial capital of ‘1’, we will start the second project which will give us profit of ‘2’. Once we selected our first project, our total capital will become 3 (profit + initial capital).\n",
    "- With ‘3’ capital, we will select the third project, which will give us ‘3’ profit.\n",

    "\n",
    "Output: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With ‘0’ capital, we can only select the first project, bringing out capital to 1.\n",
    "- Next, we will select the second project, which will bring our capital to 3.\n",
    "- Next, we will select the fourth project, giving us a profit of 5.\n",
    "\n",

    "- There is a maximum limit on how many projects we can select.\n",

    "Since we don’t have any constraint on time, we should choose a project, among the projects for which we have enough capital, which gives us a maximum profit. Following this greedy approach will give us the best solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Find all the projects that we can choose with the available capital.\n",
    "- From the list of projects in the 1st step, choose the project that gives us a maximum profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can follow the Two Heaps approach similar to Find the Median of a Number Stream. Here are the steps of our algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add all project capitals to a min-heap, so that we can select a project with the smallest capital requirement.\n",
    "- Go through the top projects of the min-heap and filter the projects that can be completed within our available capital. Insert the profits of all these projects into a max-heap, so that we can choose a project with the maximum profit.\n",

    "\n",
    "This problem follows the Two Pointers pattern and shares similarities with Pair with Target Sum. A couple of differences are that the input array is not sorted and instead of a pair we need to find triplets with a target sum of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow a similar approach, first, we will sort the array and then iterate through it taking one number at a time. Let’s say during our iteration we are at number ‘X’, so we need to find ‘Y’ and ‘Z’ such that X + Y + Z == 0X+Y+Z==0. At this stage, our problem translates into finding a pair whose sum is equal to “-X−X” (as from the above equation Y + Z == -XY+Z==−X).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference from Pair with Target Sum is that we need to find all the unique triplets. To handle this, we have to skip any duplicate number. Since we will be sorting the array, so all the duplicate numbers will be next to each other and are easier to skip.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity #\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting the array will take O(N * logN). The searchPair() function will take O(N). \n",
    "As we are calling searchPair() for every number in the input array, this means that overall searchTriplets() will take O(N * logN + N^2), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N^2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity #\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring the space required for the output array, the space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) which is required for sorting.\n"

    "## Comparing Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will cover different types of complexity measures like Big O and their uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction #\n",
    "\n",
    "There are typically several different algorithms to solve a given computational problem. It is natural, then, to compare these alternatives. But how do we know if algorithm A is better than algorithm B?\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Criteria: Time and Space #\n",
    "\n",
    "One important factor that determines the “goodness” of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes to solve a given problem. If algorithm A takes less time to solve the same problem than does algorithm B, then algorithm A is considered better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important factor to compare two algorithms is the amount of memory required to solve a given problem. The algorithm that requires less memory is considered better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing Execution Time #\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remainder of this lesson, we will focus on the first factor, i.e., execution time. How do we compare the execution time of two algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimental Evaluation #\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we could implement the two algorithms and run them on a computer while measuring the execution time. The algorithm with less execution time wins. One thing is for sure, this comparison must be done in a fair manner. Let’s try to punch holes into this idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An algorithm might take longer to run on an input of greater size. Thus, algorithms being compared must be tested on the same input size. But that’s not all. Due to the presence of conditional statements, for a given input size, even the same algorithm’s running time may vary with the actual input given to it. This means that the algorithms being compared must be tested on the same input. Since one algorithm may be disadvantaged over another for a specific input, we must test the algorithms exhaustively on all possible input values. This is just not possible.\n",
    "- The algorithms being compared must first be implemented. What if the programmer comes up with a better implementation of one algorithm than the other? What if the compiler optimizes one algorithm more than it does the other? There’s so much that can compromise the fairness at this stage.\n",
    "- The programs implementing the two algorithms must be tested on exactly the same hardware and software environment. Far fetched as it may be, we could assign a single machine for all scientists to test their algorithms on. Even if we did, the task scheduling in modern day operating systems involves a lot of randomness. What if the program corresponding to “the best” algorithm encounters an excessive number of hardware interrupts? It is impossible to guarantee the same hardware / software environment to ensure a fair comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical Evaluation #\n",
    "\n",
    "The above list highlights some of the factors that make fair experimental evaluation of algorithms impossible. Instead, we are forced to do an analytical / theoretical comparison. The two key points that we hold on to, from the previous discussion, is that we must compare algorithms for the same input size and consider all possible inputs of the given size. Here is how it is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume a hypothetical computer on which some primitive operations are executed in a constant amount of time. We consider a specific input size, say, n. We, then, count the number of primitive operations executed by an algorithm for a given input. The algorithm that results in fewer primitive operations is considered better.\n",
    "\n",
    "What constitutes a primitive operation, though? You can think of these as simple operations that are typically implemented as processor instructions. These operations include assignment to a variable or array index, reading from a variable or array index, comparing two values, arithmetic operations, context switch that results from a function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the control is transferred from the calling function to the called function, that is what we call a context switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is not considered a primitive operation? While the context switch is a primitive operation, the function invocation as a whole is not always a single primitive operation. A function call’s cost is considered to be the sum of the primitive operations in the function body. Similarly, displaying an entire array is not a primitive operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of times conditional statements run depends on the actual input values. Sometimes a code block is executed, some times it isn’t. So, how do we account for conditional statements? We can adopt one of three strategies: best case analysis, average-case analysis, and worst-case analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Case Analysis #\n",
    "\n",
    "In the best case analysis, we consider the specific input that results in the execution of the fewest possible primitive operations. This gives us a lower bound on the execution time of that algorithm for a given input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worst-Case Analysis #\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst-case analysis, we consider the specific input that results in the execution of the maximum possible primitive operations. This gives us an upper bound on the execution time of that algorithm for a given input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Case Analysis #\n",
    "\n",
    "In the average case analysis, we try to determine the average number of primitive operations executed for all possible inputs of a given size. This is not as easy as it may sound to the uninitiated. In order to compute the average-case running time of an algorithm, we must know the relative frequencies of all possible inputs of a given size. We compute the weighted average of the number of primitive operations executed for each input. But how can we accurately predict the distribution of inputs? If the algorithm encounters a different distribution of inputs in the field, our analysis is useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Verdict #\n",
    "\n",
    "The best-case analysis has limited value because what if you deploy that algorithm and the best case input rarely occurs. We feel that the worst-case analysis is more useful because whatever answer it gives you, you can be sure that no matter what, algorithm A wouldn’t incur more time than that. Unless otherwise specified, our analysis in this course will be worst-case running time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The running time of an algorithm computed in the aforementioned way is also known as its time complexity. Another term that you will often hear is an algorithm’s space complexity. The space complexity of an algorithm is the amount of additional or auxiliary memory space that the algorithm requires. This is memory space other than the actual input itself. We will see examples of evaluating the space complexity of an algorithm later on in this course.\n",

This fits in nicely with our need for comparing algorithms for very large input sizes.\n",

    "Caveat: Merge sort works better on linked lists and there are other non-comparison-based algorithms that outperform Quick Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps for quick sort algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with a list of n elements\n",
    "- Choose a pivot element from the list to be sorted\n",
    "- Partition the list into 2 unsorted sublists, such that all elements in one sublist are less than the pivot and all the elements in the other sublist are greater than the pivot\n",
    "- Elements that are equal to the pivot can go in either sublist\n",
    "- Sort each sublist recursively to yield two sorted sublists\n",
    "- Concatenate the two sorted sublists and the pivot to yield one sorted list\n",
    "\n",
    "How to pick the pivot? #\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two methods by which you can choose a pivot:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose randomly #\n",
    "\n",
    "Median of three strategy #\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick three random elements from the list and choose their median. This strategy ensures that the first element is not picked.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, at every recursive call (nn of which occur), the entire list is iterated over to sort the elements into the appropriate sub-list. This is also why the time complexity of this scenario is in O(n^2).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can probably guess that the occurrence of the worst case is infrequent. Furthermore, the chances of the worst-case scenario occurring can be reduced considerably by picking a good pivot. Let’s have a look.\n"
