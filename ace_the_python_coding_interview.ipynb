As we have described above, each number will definitely have a cycle.

    "- If the number N is less than or equal to 1000, \n",

    "From the above Wikipedia link, we know that the sum of the squares of the digits of ‘N’ is at most 9^2M, or 81M81M (this will happen when all digits of ‘N’ are ‘9’).\n",

    "Rotating by one node is very simple; just find the last node of the linked list and move it to the head of the linked list. One way of solving our original problem is to rotate by one node (i.e. last node of a linked list) n times. Getting to the last node of a linked list requires a linear scan, so this algorithm requires n scans of the linked list. The time complexity of this algorithm will be O(mn)O(mn) where mm is the length of the linked list and nn is the number of rotations needed. However, there is an alternate and simpler algorithm that avoids multiple scans of the linked list. We know that performing n rotations (if n > 0) of the last node is equivalent to performing one rotation of the last n nodes of the linked list. So O(n) algorithm to find the list rotated by n nodes is below:\n",

    "- Find the length of the linked list.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- If the adjusted number of rotations is 0, then just return the head pointer. This means that no rotations were needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find the nth node from the last node of the linked list. As we already have the length of the linked list, it is simpler. It is basically getting to the node ‘x’ at length ‘n - N’. Next pointer of node previous to this node, i.e., ‘x’ should be updated to point to NULL.\n",
